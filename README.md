# Instagram MERN fullstack mock-up

This is a 2 day attempt to replicate instagram using a MERN stack. This includes Mongodb,Node.js and Express in  the back ned and React for the client side front end. Most of it followed a tutorial on YOUTUBE by one of the nicest sounding and enthusiatistic people out there (Mukesh thanks for the tips).Really enjoyed his chat and reccommend as have built up confidence with react AND express (search: MERN Stack Instagram clone tutorial... just the 53 videos to get through:)) as well as implemeneting the fundmanetals we learned over the last two weeks of the javascript section of the bootcamp.
